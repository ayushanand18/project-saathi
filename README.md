*Project Saathi for Google Developer Students Club Solution Challenge 2022*
## Introduction
According to recent studies, 1 In 10 Indian Adolescents Faces Cyber Bullying, half don’t report [1].  Another survey conducted by National Family Health Survey (NFHS) conducted in 2015-16 and compiled by NCRB shows that  estimated 99.1% of sexual violence cases are not reported [2]. And there are many other surveys about unreported abuse cases.
The common reason found behind all these unreported cases is the hesitation of the victim to open up to others for asking help which is further strengthened due to personal reasons.  
Project Saathi aims to promote justice for all who have gone through harassment, bullying or violence in any form and shape. Saathi, the chatbot uses machine learning as a tool for faster and effective actions. 

## Statistics
In institutions of higher education (IHEs), 23.1% of female and 5.4% of male undergraduate students experience rape or sexual assault by use of physical force, violence, or incapacitation [3], yet an estimated 80% of incidents are not reported [4]. Rape or sexual assault are about half as likely to be reported to police as robbery (54%) and aggravated assault (58%), with the former being reported in only about a quarter of all cases (23%) [5]. Social stigma surrounding sexual crimes likely contributes to this low level of reporting

## Objective
Our objective is to provide help from legal authorities to those victims who do not even report their cases due to reasons such as lack of sources, neglect, fear of privacy invasion and many others.
Saathi is an exceptional chatbot which helps the user to muster up the courage to open about the unpleasant experience they have gone through, and encourage them to report and get help from legal authorities or NGOs. It provides a fast response to the users, at the same time, also maintains their privacy. Even if the user prefers to not report, they can at least share their pain which they usually wouldn’t have.

## Privacy
Lending a helping hand to all our users and simultaneously safeguarding their privacy is one of the main features of the project. This is managed in following steps: 
Step1: A unique 16 digit code will be provided to each user which will be required to copy for later use. 
Step2: Consent of the user will be taken to pass on the matter to legal authorities or NGOs.
Step3: If the consent is given, Saathi, the Chatbot will ask for the email id and 16 digit code of the user. 
Step4: Only the email id will be forwarded directly to legal authorities to initiate contact with the user. The User needs to provide a 16 digit code to confirm the final ascent.
